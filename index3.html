            <h2>A B O U T</h2> 
            <p>One of the most humane organizations in Nigeria, founded shortly after the Civial war, the Animal Shelter has
                seen vast changes in the society, the environment, and the roles of animals in our lives. It has helped make
                laws and set standards that have fundamentally shaped our sense of kindness and care for animals and for one
                another.
                Today, the Animal Shelter continues to rescue, shelter, protect, heal, and advocate for more animals than any
                other Nigerian humane organization, giving hands-in care to many thousands of animals each year. We also provide
                emergency assistance and strategic-planning help for animal-protection groups across the country and around the
                globe. Through our legislative work, humane-education efforts and community-based assistance initiatives, we
                help create lasting change for animals and people.
